Daily scrum - Every day at 9am
=============================

Each member writes down answers to 3 questions:

1. What I have done/not done since last Scrum?
2. What I plan to do from this scrum to next?
3. Where do I need assistance? What do I need to figure out?

01/03/2018
Larisa:
1. Done: Changed the design of all the frames, created Responsibilities txt file to have an additional source of communication on what is planned(for the things that are not in Trello or are very general and setting them in Trello when it's just an idea but, for all the tasks will take time). Also created a file useful links with links on things that may be needed for the project. Linked all the frames up until into the Welcome.Created a separate class for login and connected it to the initially main java file. Changed the main Java file to Login as this is the starting point.
2. Link the menus of all the pages. Review if the design is ok or there are any changes to be done. Decide if there should be all the frames in the same class.. quite difficult logistically.
3. Need to see where we are at. See what is left to be done from both sides and what are the things we didn't yet touch at all. Then split the tasks to be performed on introducing the logic. Need to get explanations from both side on what have been done verbally.

02/03/2018
Larisa:
1.Updated Trello, worked on registration and on login. Login worked.. before we changed the way the frames are done. Worked on the details for the initialInfo.
2.Redo the frames to dialogs. Make a global class and figure out how to deal with it.
3.We need to make sure the git works. I am working in branch right now. And each time I commit I make pull requests. To the main to make sure everything is ok.
We have a final project separately open. We will have to use that one just to conclude everything. Now with separate classes it will be easier to make it all work fine.

03/03/2018
Tung:
1. I'm back on master branch with load of conflicts fixed. Registration functions, it leads user back to login.
2. Continue InitialInfo. Might help Larisa if she needs with merging her branch to master.
3. Get userId from userName and store each registered budget in budgetsMonthlyByCat with userId.

03/03/2018
Larisa:
1. I didn't try to go back to the master. I will create another branch from master now in order to continue from there to make sure that nothing is creating conflicts. 
2. The design of the app has to be slightly changed to minimize the quantity of windows that we have in the app for now. Up till now the login, registration and initial info were worked on.
3. We need to collect the information what was done until now. All the functions of the connection to the database have to be in the database class. If there is an argument why it shouldn't be so we need to discuss it.
 public void windowClosing(java.awt.event.WindowEvent e) {
            System.exit(0);
          } this will close the window? Or the whole app? Just want to make sure.

04/03/2018
Tung:

04/03/2018
Larisa:
1.Not done with the passing the information on the currentUser from one frame to another. We need to clarify how to do it as for now the user is reset in each Frame instead of using the one passed in the previous.
2.Rearranged all the visual. Worked on the piping up of the initial info after login in no history in the transactions for the past month. This is were I found that we need to organize the whole app differently. 
3.Need to figure this connection story somehow.

05/03/2018
Tung:
1. 'max-user-connections' is addressed: too many unnessessary connections to the database at once.
2. Clean classes by removing overkill CRUD methods to database using 1 connection. Reorganize some helper methods. Implement AddIncome, AddExpense windows
3. Which event triggered similar to on-open to setText() on textfield name of AddIncome, AddExpense.
